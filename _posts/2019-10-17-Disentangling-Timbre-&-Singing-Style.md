ABSTRACT

Singing voice consists of pitch, pronunciation, and singer's style. To date, most of the singing voice synthesis studies are basically studied in a way that allows control of pitch and pronunciation. Some studies may control the style of a singer, but in this case most of the time, the extension to a multi-singer model with simple speaker embedding added. We noted that the singer's style includes not only the singer's timbre but also the 'singing style' that forms the pitch contours. In this study, we proposed a multi-singer singing synthetic network that can model timbre and singing styles independently.
